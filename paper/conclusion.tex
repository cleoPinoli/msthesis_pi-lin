\section{Concluding Remarks}
\label{sec:conclusion}

context splitting hard to read but overall doable

working with an intrinsically typed calculus drastically reduces the number of
cases that must be considered in proving properties (eg deadlock freedom)

it also makes it trivial to reason about properties of sub-processes (see type
safety, where Q is well typed)

structural pre-congruence by far most involved, and it will grow even further in
order to prove more complex properties (eg confluence)

linear pi-calculus is good

we think that a simple formalization is a good basis for further investigations.
For examples, defined cut elimination, strong normalization, soundness of
subtyping, for the linear fragment of \Calculus
