\subsection{Context Representation}
\label{sec:context-agda}

We are going to adopt a nameless representation of channels whereby a channel is
identified by its position in a typing context. This representation is akin to
using De Bruijn indices, except that the index, instead of being represented
explicitly by a natural number, is computable from the \emph{proof} that the
type of the channel belong to the typing context.
%
Typing contexts are represented using \emph{lists} of types, where the
(polymorphic) \AgdaDatatype{List} type is defined in Agda′s standard library.

\begin{code}
Context : Set
Context = List Type
\end{code}

The most important operation concerning typing contexts is \emph{splitting}. The
splitting of $\ContextC$ into $\ContextD$ and $\ContextE$, which is denoted by
$\Splitting\ContextC\ContextD\ContextE$, represents the fact that $\ContextC$
contains all the types contained in $\ContextD$ and $\ContextE$, preserving both
their overall \emph{multiplicity} and also their relative \emph{order} within
$\ContextD$ and $\ContextE$. A \emph{proof} of
$\Splitting\ContextC\ContextD\ContextE$ shows how the types in $\ContextC$ are
distributed in $\ContextD$ and $\ContextE$ from left to right.

\begin{code}[hide]
infix 4 _≃_+_ _≃_,_
\end{code}
\begin{code}
data _≃_+_ : Context → Context → Context → Set where
  split-e  : [] ≃ [] + []
  split-l  : ∀{A Γ Δ Θ} → Γ ≃ Δ + Θ → A ∷ Γ ≃ A ∷ Δ + Θ
  split-r  : ∀{A Γ Δ Θ} → Γ ≃ Δ + Θ → A ∷ Γ ≃ Δ + A ∷ Θ
\end{code}

As an example, below is the splitting of the context $[A, B, C, D]$ into $[A,
D]$ and $[B, C]$. Note how the sequence of \AgdaInductiveConstructor{split-l}
and \AgdaInductiveConstructor{split-r} applications determines where each of the
types in $[A, B, C, D]$ ends up in $[A, D]$ and $[B, C]$.

\begin{code}[hide]
module _ where
  postulate A B C D : Type
\end{code}
\begin{code}
  splitting-example : (A ∷ B ∷ C ∷ D ∷ []) ≃ (A ∷ D ∷ []) + (B ∷ C ∷ [])
  splitting-example = split-l (split-r (split-r (split-l split-e)))
\end{code}

It is often the case that the context $\ContextD$ in a splitting
$\Splitting\ContextC\ContextD\ContextE$ is a singleton list $[A]$. For this
particular case, we introduce a dedicated notation that allows us to represent
this case in a more compact and readable way, as
$\SimpleSplitting\ContextC{A}\ContextE$.

\begin{code}
_≃_,_ : Context → Type → Context → Set
Γ ≃ A , Δ = Γ ≃ [ A ] + Δ
\end{code}

Context splitting enjoys a number of expected properties. In particular, it is
easy to see that splitting is commutative and that the empty context is both a
left and right unit of splitting.

\begin{code}
+-comm    : ∀{Γ Δ Θ} → Γ ≃ Δ + Θ → Γ ≃ Θ + Δ
+-unit-l  : ∀{Γ} → Γ ≃ [] + Γ
+-unit-r  : ∀{Γ} → Γ ≃ Γ + []
\end{code}
\begin{code}[hide]
+-comm split-e = split-e
+-comm (split-l p) = split-r (+-comm p)
+-comm (split-r p) = split-l (+-comm p)

+-unit-l {[]} = split-e
+-unit-l {_ ∷ _} = split-r +-unit-l

+-unit-r = +-comm +-unit-l
\end{code}

E QUESTO?
\begin{code}
++≃+ : ∀{Γ Δ} → Γ ++ Δ ≃ Γ + Δ
++≃+ {[]} = +-unit-l
++≃+ {_ ∷ _} = split-l ++≃+
\end{code}

Context splitting is also associative in a sense that is made precise below. If
we write $\ContextD + \ContextE$ for some $\ContextC$ such that $Γ ≃ Δ + Θ$, then
we can prove that $Γ_1 + (Γ_2 + Γ_3) = (Γ_1 + Γ_2) + Γ_3$.

\begin{code}
+-assoc-r  : ∀{Γ Δ Θ Δ′ Θ′} → Γ ≃ Δ + Θ → Θ ≃ Δ′ + Θ′ →
             ∃[ Γ′ ] Γ′ ≃ Δ + Δ′ × Γ ≃ Γ′ + Θ′
+-assoc-l  : ∀{Γ Δ Θ Δ′ Θ′} → Γ ≃ Δ + Θ → Δ ≃ Δ′ + Θ′ →
             ∃[ Γ′ ] Γ′ ≃ Θ′ + Θ × Γ ≃ Δ′ + Γ′
\end{code}
\begin{code}[hide]
+-assoc-r split-e split-e = [] , split-e , split-e
+-assoc-r (split-l p) q with +-assoc-r p q
... | _ , p′ , q′ = _ , split-l p′ , split-l q′
+-assoc-r (split-r p) (split-l q) with +-assoc-r p q
... | _ , p′ , q′ = _ , split-r p′ , split-l q′
+-assoc-r (split-r p) (split-r q) with +-assoc-r p q
... | _ , p′ , q′ = _ , p′ , split-r q′

+-assoc-l p q with +-assoc-r (+-comm p) (+-comm q)
... | Δ , r , p′ = Δ , +-comm r , +-comm p′

+-empty-l : ∀{Γ Δ} → Γ ≃ [] + Δ → Γ ≡ Δ
+-empty-l split-e = refl
+-empty-l (split-r p) = cong (_ ∷_) (+-empty-l p)

+-sing-l : ∀{A B Γ} → [ A ] ≃ B , Γ → A ≡ B × Γ ≡ []
+-sing-l (split-l split-e) = refl , refl

data Un : Context → Set where
  un-[]  : Un []
  un-∷   : ∀{A Γ} → Un Γ → Un (¿ A ∷ Γ)
\end{code}
